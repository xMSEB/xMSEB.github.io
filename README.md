# Extended MSEB: Enhanced Brain Bundling Algorithm

The **Extended MSEB (xMSEB)** project builds upon the original [Brain Bundler](https://github.com/NeuroanatomyAndConnectivity/brainbundler) tool by incorporating improvements to the Mean Shift Edge Bundling (MSEB) algorithm. This repository provides the upgraded source files for extending and refining the bundling of brain connectivity data.

---

## Overview

**Extended MSEB** is designed to improve the visual and structural clarity of bundled brain connectivity graphs. It enhances the original mean-shift bundling algorithm to produce smoother, more anatomically faithful bundles while maintaining compatibility with the existing `brainbundler` framework.

The base functionality comes from **brainbundler**, which includes:

- **Bundler** — a command-line tool for mean-shift edge bundling
- **FibViewer** — a simple 3D viewer for `.fib` files generated by the bundler

The Extended MSEB version modifies key components in the bundling process for better performance and visual quality.

## Installation and Setup

The easiest way to set up the **xMSEB** algorithm is as follows:

1. **Install Qt**

   - Instructions for setting up Qt can be found here:  
     [Setting Up QT](https://doc.qt.io/qt-6/get-and-install-qt.html)

1. **Clone Repository**
   - Clone our repository: [xMSEB](https://github.com/ToporDB/xMSEB).
1. **Compiling xMSEB**

   - **Bundler** and **FibViewer** are part of the repository and needs to be built by QT Creator, so after downloading it, open the bundler/bundler.pro and fibviewer/fibviewer.pro files with QT Creator.
   - Inside QT Creator, click on the "Build Project" (lower left corner) for both bundler and fibviewer software.
   - QT will create a build/Desktop-(Debug/Release/Profile)/ folders inside the software directory, where inside, you will find the runnable executables bundler or fibviewer.

1. **Running the project**
   - Use the executables to run your dataset and visualize it with fibviewer.

## Usage

After building, you can use the extended bundler just like the original:

```bash
bundler -nodes "nodes.txt" -cons "edges.txt" -fileName "output_name" [-c_thr 0.8] [-start_i 10] [-numcycles 7] [-bell 5] [-directed 0] [-smooth 3]
fibviewer "output_name".fib
```

## Input File Formats

### Node File

Each line contains one node’s 3D coordinates:

```
x0 y0 z0
x1 y1 z1
x2 y2 z2
...
```

### Connections File

Each line defines an edge between two nodes (0-indexed):

```
0 3
2 3
4 1
...
```

To convert ASCII node/connection files into a `.fib` file:

```bash
bundler -nodes "nodesfile" -cons "connectionsfile" -numcycles 0
```

| `-numcycles` | Total number of bundling cycles                         | `7`     |
| `-bell`      | Width of Gaussian kernel for weighting                  | `5`     |
| `-smooth`    | Number of smoothing steps after bundling                | `3`     |

## Visualizing Results

To visualize or export bundled data:

```bash
fibviewer "output.fib"
```

Example datasets (like `artificialconnections`) can be used for quick testing:

```bash
fibviewer artificial -writefib
fibviewer artificial.fib -writeobj
```
